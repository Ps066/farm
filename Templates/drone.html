          <H2> WHY ADOPT AGRICULTURAL DRONES?</H2>
          <P>Drone technology has gotten most of the recognition in the industry because of its diversity and considered the future for the agrarian community. The military initially used them. However, other sectors quickly embraced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) when they learned about its widespread applications.</P>

<P>How can drones support Indian agriculture? Drones don't merely enhance overall performance but also encourage farmers to solve other assorted barriers and receive plenty of benefits through precision agriculture. With the market for agricultural drones reaching a whopping $1.3 billion, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) fill the gap of human error and inefficiency by traditional farming methods. The purpose of adopting drone technology is to exclude any guesswork or ambiguity and instead focus on accurate and reliable information.</P>

<P>External factors like weather, soil conditions, and temperature play a critical role in farming. Agriculture drone empowers the farmer to adapt to specific environments and make mindful choices accordingly. The gained data helps regulate crop health, crop treatment, crop scouting, irrigation, and carry out field soil analysis and crop damage assessments. The drone survey helps boost crop yields and minimize time and expenses.</P>

            <P>Our experienced drone pilots can obtain high-resolution data that can provide vital information for measuring and documenting damage to crops from unforeseen factors such as floods, fires, pests, weather events, etc. Data from drones with remote sensing capabilities and Photogrammetry acts as evidence for farmers or government authorities to claim crop insurance or to obtain an estimate accordingly. Data retrieved from advanced sensors represented as 2D or 3D Orthomosaics help farmers understand and find novel alternatives to increase crop yields and reduce crop damage simultaneously.<P>
                <LI><B>PESTICIDE SPRAYING</B></LI>
            <P>Chemicals to kill pests and unwanted plants such as weeds and spraying pesticides is crucial for maintaining crop health. Drones fitted with pesticide spraying equipment function more efficiently and for a fraction of the cost compared to manual spraying. Not only are we achieving Precision Agriculture by saving time and labor costs significantly, but we are also protecting farmers from coming into contact with various toxic chemicals.</P>
            <LI><B>FIELD SOIL ANALYSIS</B></LI/>
            <P>The soil quality of crops can either make or break a farmer's productivity. Soil Analysis is a crucial step to be taken by farmers during the crop-cycle. Our drones, such as the DJI Phantom 4 Pro, provide real-time and precise analysis of soil's overall health. Through Precision Agriculture, one can discern issues surrounding soil quality, nutrient management, or dead soil zones. This data supports farmers in determining the most effective farming patterns of planting, managing crops, and soil. Not to mention, field soil analysis also increases the safety and health of workers.</P>
